Management Summary: Robotic Process Automation for Tagetik Reports

1. Process Description / Problem Statement

The current process of running Tagetik reports is highly repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Key challenges include:

Reports need to be generated 30-40 times per year, with significantly higher frequency during the planning phase (up to 1-2 times per day for certain reports).

Many reports require execution in multiple variants (e.g., per legal entity, different currency types), increasing manual workload.

During financial closing periods, reports must be run multiple times per day, precisely when time is most critical and deadlines are tight.

Stakeholders rely on these reports to be ready before the start of their workday, meaning any delay disrupts dependent workflows.

Running a single report requires up to 9 manual prompts, some involving multiple selections, which is both time-consuming and error-prone.

The process is entirely digital, repetitive, and rule-based, making it an ideal candidate for automation.

Additional monthly closing processes could also benefit from automation, unlocking even greater efficiency gains.

2. Key Objectives / Benefits

Implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for Tagetik report generation will provide the following benefits:

✅ Significant Time & Cost Savings

Automating the process will eliminate 2.5 hours per run spent on clearance and management reports alone.

Controllers can focus on high-value tasks rather than repetitive data extraction.

✅ Error-Free Execution

Eliminates manual errors in prompt entries, particularly in complex multi-value selections and naming conventions (e.g., specifying the correct Generali legal entity).

✅ Faster Closing & Deadline Adherence

Frees up controllers during peak periods, enabling a faster and smoother financial closing process.

Minimizes delays, ensuring critical business deadlines are met.

✅ Improved Employee Satisfaction

Eliminates a monotonous and frustrating task, allowing employees to focus on more strategic activities.

Prevents unnecessary laptop downtime during each manual report run.

✅ Optimized System Utilization

Automation enables reports to be scheduled at 3 AM, immediately after the Tagetik GHO load, ensuring:

Faster load times due to minimal system activity.

Reduced system strain during business hours, keeping resources available for other critical tasks.

Conclusion

By implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for Tagetik report generation, FinCo will achieve:

Greater efficiency and accuracy in financial reporting,

Significant time and cost savings,

Enhanced employee satisfaction and productivity, and

Optimized system performance and resource utilization.

This automation initiative represents a low-risk, high-reward investment, unlocking additional automation opportunities in financial reporting and beyond. Approval is recommended to proceed with implementation.
